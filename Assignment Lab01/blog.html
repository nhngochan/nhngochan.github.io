          🌐 Sharing the lessons I learned from my first real HTML project...
        </p>
        <p>
          Building my first real HTML project was both exciting and humbling. I
          started with simple tags and a blank page, but soon realized that
          creating a functional, well-structured website takes more than just
          code — it’s about design, accessibility, and storytelling. Along the
          way, I learned how to use semantic HTML to give meaning to content,
          organize layouts with CSS, and debug small mistakes that taught me big
          lessons. What surprised me most was how small details — like
          consistent spacing, responsive design, or alt text — can completely
          change the user experience. This project didn’t just teach me HTML and
          CSS; it helped me think like a web developer — balancing creativity
          with logic, aesthetics with structure. Now, when I open my browser and
          see something I built from scratch, I don’t just see a webpage — I see
          growth, patience, and the first step of a long journey in web
          development. 🚀
